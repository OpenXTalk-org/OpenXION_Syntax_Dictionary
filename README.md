# OpenXION Syntax Dictionary

Syntax dictionary for the xTalk script dialect OpenXION:
https://github.com/kreativekorp/openxion

OpenXION is a highly HyperTalk-compatible xTalk interpreter that runs on a Java VM (VMs Oracle JDK 8+, Open JDK 11,17+, GraalVM all worked fine for me). It lacks any sort of Graphical Interface controls. It's an xTalk but not an 'xCard'. However since like HyperTalk syntax keywords are not reserved, and so it is possible to write custom 'ask/answer' handlers that supercede the built-in textual interface with windows with controls using a UI toolkit such as Tkinter (via Python 2) or using AppleScript Dialons on macOS.
